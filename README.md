# Age-and-gender-classification-from-low-quality-human-face-images
This project aims to handle and enhance the low-quality images of three different type ( Low-light, Blurred, Pixelated ) and predict the appropriate age and gender of the person on the image

# Instruction on how to run the model 
Due to the large file sizes of the model, the pre-trained models are not available in this GitHub repository but are shared via Google Drive instead. Below are instructions for using these pre-trained models to make predictions on .jpg files.

## 1) Downloading the models

Visit the Google Drive link via your web browser at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iveL4WAu1PFulao2pa0cinBGvuBM-jA-/view?usp=sharing . There should a folder named Dataset. which contain the models for image enhancement as well as age and gender prediction. Download the folder and place it inside the project the folder

## 2) Making predictions

From any code editor or from the command prompt run file main.py 

## 3) Sample Results 
### 1) Low Light Image
