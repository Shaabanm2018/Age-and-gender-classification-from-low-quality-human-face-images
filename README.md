# Low-Quality Image Enhancement and Age-Gender Classification System

## Overview:
This section provides a high-level introduction to the project, explaining that it is designed to address the challenges posed by low-quality images (low-light, blurred, pixelated) by improving image quality and predicting the age and gender of individuals within these images.

## Instruction on how to run the model
This section outlines the steps required to use the pre-trained models for making predictions on .jpg files. It includes instructions for downloading the models and running the main.py file.

### 1) Downloading the models
This subsection explains the process of downloading the pre-trained models for image enhancement and age-gender prediction from the provided Google Drive link and placing them in the project folder.

### 2) Making predictions
This subsection instructs the user to run the main.py file from a code editor or the command prompt to make predictions.

### 3) Image Enhancement
This subsection is further divided into three parts, each showcasing the image enhancement capabilities of the system for different types of low-quality images:

#### 1) Low Light Image Enhancement
This part demonstrates the system's ability to enhance low-light images, improving their quality and making them more suitable for age-gender classification.
